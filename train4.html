        <h1>Bombardier BiLevel</h1>
        <p>The BiLevel coaches were designed by Toronto's regional commuter rail service, GO Transit and Hawker Siddeley Canada in the mid-1970s as a more efficient replacement for GO's original single-deck coaches and cab cars.[1] Later coaches were manufactured by Urban Transportation Development Corporation/Can-Car and, most recently, Bombardier. Alstom purchased Bombardier in 2021 and now owns the designs and manufacturing facility. There are more than 1,500 BiLevel coaches in service today, all of which have been built in Thunder Bay, Ontario.</p>
